With \\nthese ends in mind, we wish to make the following pro -\\nposals concerning the custody, maintenance and use of \\nthe records of individuals enumerated in decennial pop -\\nulation censuses: \\nThe Bureau of the Census will transfer to the National \\nArchives and Records Service (1) the original schedules of \\neach decennial population census when they are no longer \\nrequired by the Bureau of the Census for active statistical \\nuse and when the National Archives and Records Service \\ncan provide space and service for them; (2) the negative \\nmicrofilm of such schedules when the Bureau of the Cen -\\nsus has obtained a positive copy of the microfilm; and \\n(3) the positive microfilm of these schedules when they \\nare no longer required by the Bureau of the Census in its \\npersonal census service activities.\\nThe Bureau of the Census desires that the National \\nArchives and Records Service observe the following pro -\\nvisions pertaining to the use and maintenance of these \\nrecords subsequent to their transfer:\\nA. All negative microfilm copies of decennial pop -\\nulation census schedules transferred to the National \\nArchives and Records Service shall be preserved as the \\npermanent records of such censuses. These negative copies will not be used as searching media or inserted \\nin reading devices except when necessary for inspection \\nincident to the proper maintenance of such records.\\nB. The National Archives and Records Service will, \\nupon request by the Bureau of the Census, furnish pos -\\nitive prints of any negative microfilm which has been \\ntransferred to the former agency. The charge for this \\nservice will be the cost of the positive film and its de -\\nvelopment, plus a service charge of not more than ten \\npercent.\\nC. At no time after the National Archives and Re -\\ncords Service has accepted custody of both the negative \\nand positive microfilm copies of the schedules of a cen -\\nsus will both negative and positive copies of that census \\nbe kept in the same city.\\nD. After the lapse of seventy-two years from the enu -\\nmeration date of a decennial census, the National Ar -\\nchives and Records Service may disclose information \\ncontained in these records for use in legitimate histori -\\ncal, genealogical or other worth-while research, provid -\\ned adequate precautions are taken to make sure that the \\ninformation disclosed is not to be used to the detriment \\nof any of the persons whose records are involved. Prior \\nto the lapse of time specified above, the information \\nwill be disclosed only by the Bureau of the Census from \\nmicrophotographic or other records in its possession.  \\nPlease let us know if these provisions are acceptable \\nto you.

Our democratic principles \\nrequire that the American people be informed of the \\nactivities of their Government. Also, our Nation’s progress \\ndepends on the free flow of information both within the \\nGovernment and to the American people. Nevertheless, \\nthroughout our history, the national defense has required \\nthat certain information be maintained in confidence in \\norder to protect our citizens, our democratic institutions, \\nour homeland security, and our interactions with \\nforeign nations. Protecting information critical to our \\nNation’s security and demonstrating our commitment \\nto open Government through accurate and accountable \\napplication of classification standards and routine, secure, \\nand effective declassification are equally important \\npriorities.\\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, by the \\nauthority vested in me as President by the Constitution \\nand the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby \\nordered as follows:\\nPART 1 — ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION\\nSection 1.1.  Classification Standards.  (a) Information \\nmay be originally classified under the terms of this order \\nonly if all of the following conditions are met:\\n(1) an original classification authority is classifying the \\ninformation;\\n(2) the information is owned by, produced by or for, \\nor is under the control of the United States Government;\\n(3) the information falls within one or more of the cat -\\negories of information listed in section 1.4 of this order; \\nand\\n(4) the original classification authority determines that \\nthe unauthorized disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national se -\\ncurity, which includes defense against transnational ter -\\nrorism, and the original classification authority is able to \\nidentify or describe the damage.\\n(b) If there is significant doubt about the need to classify \\ninformation, it shall not be classified. This provision does \\nnot:\\n(1) amplify or modify the substantive criteria or proce -\\ndures for classification; or\\n(2) create any substantive or procedural rights subject \\nto judicial review.\\n(c) Classified information shall not be declassified \\nautomatically as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of \\nidentical or similar information.\\n(d) The unauthorized disclosure of foreign government \\ninformation is presumed to cause damage to the national \\nsecurity.\\nSec. 1.2.  Classification Levels.  (a) Information may be \\nclassified at one of the following three levels:\\n(1) “Top Secret” shall be applied to information, the \\nunauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be ex -\\npected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the nation -\\nal security that the original classification authority is able \\nto identify or describe.\\n(2) “Secret” shall be applied to information, the unau -\\nthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected \\nto cause serious damage to the national security that the \\noriginal classification authority is able to identify or de -\\nscribe.\\n(3) “Confidential” shall be applied to information, the \\nunauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be ex -\\npected to cause damage to the national security that the \\noriginal classification authority is able to identify or de -\\nscribe.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Agency heads are responsible for ensuring that \\ndesignated subordinate officials have a demonstrable and \\ncontinuing need to exercise this authority.\\n(2) “Top Secret” original classification authority may be \\ndelegated only by the President, the Vice President, or an \\nagency head or official designated pursuant to paragraph \\n(a)(2) of this section.\\n(3) “Secret” or “Confidential” original classification au -\\nthority may be delegated only by the President, the Vice \\nPresident, an agency head or official designated pursuant \\nto paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or the senior agency \\nofficial designated under section 5.4(d) of this order, pro -\\nvided that official has been delegated “Top Secret” origi -\\nnal classification authority by the agency head.\\n(4) Each delegation of original classification authority \\nshall be in writing and the authority shall not be redel -\\negated except as provided in this order. Each delegation \\nshall identify the official by name or position.\\n(5) Delegations of original classification authority shall \\nbe reported or made available by name or position to the \\nDirector of the Information Security Oversight Office.(d) All original classification authorities must receive training \\nin proper classification (including the avoidance of over-\\nclassification) and declassification as provided in this order \\nand its implementing directives at least once a calendar \\nyear. Such training must include instruction on the proper \\nsafeguarding of classified information and on the sanctions \\nin section 5.5 of this order that may be brought against \\nan individual who fails to classify information properly or \\nprotect classified information from unauthorized disclosure.  \\nOriginal classification authorities who do not receive such \\nmandatory training at least once within a calendar year shall \\nhave their classification authority suspended by the agency \\nhead or the senior agency official designated under section \\n5.4(d) of this order until such training has taken place. A \\nwaiver may be granted by the agency head, the deputy agency \\nhead, or the senior agency official if an individual is unable \\nto receive such training due to unavoidable circumstances.  \\nWhenever a waiver is granted, the individual shall receive \\nsuch training as soon as practicable.\\n(e) Exceptional cases. When an employee, government \\ncontractor, licensee, certificate holder, or grantee of an \\nagency who does not have original classification authority \\noriginates information believed by that person to require \\nclassification, the information shall be protected in a \\nmanner consistent with this order and its implementing \\ndirectives.
